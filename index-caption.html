      In the Northeast, many school districts are narrowly drawn along city and suburban boundaries,
      which concentrates student poverty, as shown in Hartford, Connecticut and its surrounding
      towns. By contrast, metropolitan and county-wide school districts are more common in
      Southern and Western states, as shown in Charlotte-Mecklenberg, North Carolina.
