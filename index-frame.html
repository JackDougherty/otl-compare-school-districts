    <h2>Map: Compare US School Districts at the Same Scale, 2013</h2>
    <iframe src="index.html" width="100%" height=500></iframe>
    <p>In this interactive map, search and compare US school district boundaries and poverty data, side-by-side, at the same scale. Hover over districts to view student population and poverty data. Click any district to freeze its data panel when moving between maps.
    In the Northeast, many school districts are narrowly drawn along city and suburban boundaries, which concentrates student poverty, as shown in Hartford, Connecticut and its surrounding towns. By contrast, metropolitan and county-wide school districts are more common in Southern and Western states, as shown in Charlotte-Mecklenberg, North Carolina.
