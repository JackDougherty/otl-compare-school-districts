## Credits
- Thanks to Sara Hodges and others at http://EdBuild.org for creating the US school districts map and poverty data layers, making them publicly available on MapBox, and encouraging collaboration.
- Thanks to Dan Swick at MapBox for great advice on the geocoder input values.

## To Do
- Add Ilya's permalink code from otl-neighborhood-change
- Add basemap layer that displays more place names; see MapBox options that appear in http://geojson.io/#map=10/42.9549/-75.6161
- Ask MAGIC to support Google Analytics and remove my GA code from index.html
